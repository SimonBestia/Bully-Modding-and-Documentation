On the **PS2** version, there is a difference with IDs for vehicles, weapons and items.

More specifically, vehicles start with the ID 248 on the **PS2**, but with the ID 272 on **Scholarship Edition**. This is due to the new characters and items added.

This means that, if you want to get the **PS2** counterpart of an ID from **Scholarship Edition**, you'll have to subtract 24 for vehicles, 22 for weapons, and 34 for items.

Examples:

**PS2** | **Scholarship Edition**
------------ | -------------
248 bmxrace | 272 bmxrace
277 yardstick | 299 yardstick
428 coin_dollar | 462 coin_dollar

[_Derpy's Bully LUA Reference_](https://derpy54320.github.io/Bully-LUA-Reference/index.html) site already has the **Scholarship Edition** IDs.

If you want the PS2 ones, here is a [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/raw/KWD4s4i4) with the entire list.
