# Common Misconceptions

Once again, I see a lot of people saying how things were cut from the game for many reasons:

> "_There wasn't enough space on the DVD._"

Not true. **BULLY** has a couple hundred Megabytes of free space.

> "_The **PS2** wasn't powerful enough._"
[_Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas)

> "_Because of the **T Rating**_"

That rating is actually pretty flexible and **BULLY**'s cut content would probably not be enough to turn it to an **M Rating**.

The Joker almost drops an F-bomb in [_Injustice: Gods Among Us_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice:_Gods_Among_Us).

Realistic guns in [_Shadow The Hedgehog_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_(video_game)) (and it's not even a **T-Rated** game).

# What are the actual reasons for features being cut?

## What the developers have to say

As you may already know, [_Rockstar Games_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Games) is a pretty secretive company.
But every now and then, someone manages to contact developers, who can share stories:

> "When Bully started, it was an eight person Env team, by the third year in on production it was down to just myself and Jae Lee. Things needed to go."
