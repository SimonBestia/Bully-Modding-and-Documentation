Yes. That is _**true**_.

The **PS2** is a pretty weak system, however, may I suggest checking out other games like [_Kingdom Hearts II_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_II)?

Or, another title from [_Rockstar Games_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Games) themselves, which I'm sure you've **_at least_** heard of, [_Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas)?
