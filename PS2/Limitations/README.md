# Limitations

Yes. That is _**true**_.

The **PS2** is a pretty weak system, however, may I suggest checking out other games like

[_Kingdom Hearts II_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_II)?

Or, another title from [_Rockstar Games_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Games) themselves, which I'm sure you've **_at least_** heard of,

[_Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas)?




## Actual limitations for BULLY

Due to having very little RAM to use, things that are very common on mods made for **PC** can't be done on the **PS2**.

For example:
- Loading every Animation Group of the game to avoid A-Posing. (Forget about mods like **Super Mod** running properly on the **PS2**)
- Keeping multiple Threads running at the same time.


[_Rockstar Vancouver_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Vancouver) did things like copy-pasting the same Animation in **MANY** different Animation Groups, leading to a higher size of the game, but with the advantage of creating Animation Groups with a very specific set of Animations to use for specific missions, and avoid loading unnecessary Animations.
